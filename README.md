# ThatWasEasy
ThatWasEasy is a Gorilla Tag mod that adds the That Was Easy button into the game.  
When pushed, the button will say "That was easy." just like how the actual button does.

## Preview
Here is what the mod looks like ingame, you can enable/disable it with Computer Interface and Haunted Mod Menu and it works in any lobby.
