# ThatWasEasy
ThatWasEasy is a Gorilla Tag mod that adds the That Was Easy button into the game.  
When pushed, the button will say "That was easy." just like how the actual button does.

## Information
The mod will require the "Utilla" library which you can get from Monke Mod Manager.      
You can enable/disable it with Computer Interface and Haunted Mod Menu and it works in any lobby.
